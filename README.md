# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** aims to improve road safety by detecting signs of driver fatigue in real-time. Using facial recognition and eye-state analysis, the system monitors the driver‚Äôs eye movements and head position to assess drowsiness. If fatigue is detected, the system sends an alert to prevent potential accidents caused by drowsiness.

---

## üåü Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the driver‚Äôs facial features to detect drowsiness.
- **Eye Aspect Ratio Analysis**: Detects eyelid closure and calculates eye aspect ratio (EAR) to assess drowsiness levels.
- **Head Position Detection**: Monitors head movements to identify any signs of fatigue, such as head tilting.
- **Alert System**: Provides audible or visual alerts to the driver when drowsiness is detected.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Uses Dlib for precise facial landmark detection to track the eyes and face in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV for image processing and facial detection
  - Dlib for facial landmark detection
  - TensorFlow (optional) for any machine learning models (if applicable)
  - NumPy for numerical operations
- **Hardware**: Webcam or any camera for real-time face capture

# Intallation process

## step 1:
 Install all libraries 
 - scipy  (pip install scipy)
     - We‚Äôll need the SciPy package so we can compute the Euclidean distance between facial landmarks points in the eye aspect ratio calculation (not strictly a requirement, but you should have SciPy installed if you intend on doing any work in the computer vision, image processing, or machine learning space).

- OpenCv
  - openCv for computer vision

- numpy (pip install numpy)
  - numpy for basic processing and calcutions ...

- imutils (pip install imutils)
   - We‚Äôll also need the imutils package, my series of computer vision and image processing functions to make working with OpenCV easier.

-  pyglet (pip install pyglet)
    - we'll also need pyglet  playing sound such as .mp3 , .wav ...  

-  dlib
   - To detect and localize facial landmarks we‚Äôll need the dlib library


# installation of Dlib libary 
These instructions assume you are on macOS, but basically the same on Linux.

Pre-reqs:
- Have Python 3 installed. On macOS, this could be installed from homebrew or even via standard 
  Python 3.6 downloaded installer from https://www.python.org/download. On Linux, just use your
  package manager.
- On macOS:
  - Install XCode from the Mac App Store (or install the XCode command line utils).
  - Have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed
  - Install boost with this command: `brew install boost-python --with-python3 --without-python`
- On Linux:
  - Install boost. On Ubuntu, that's `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
- This assumes you don't have an nVidia GPU and don't have Cuda and cuDNN installed and don't want
  GPU acceleration (since none of the current Mac models support this).
- On Windows:
  - Please follow this link to install dlib on Windows: https://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-windows/

Clone the code from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/THIMOTHY732/main.git
```

Build the main dlib library:

```bash
cd dlib
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DDLIB_USE_CUDA=0 -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .
```

Build and install the Python extensions:

```bash
cd ..
python3 setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS --no DLIB_USE_CUDA
```

At this point, you should be able to run `python3` and type `import dlib` successfully.

# if you have python 2.7.---
```bash
cd ..
python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS --no DLIB_USE_CUDA
```
# step 2
- Download the dlib‚Äôs pre-trained facial landmark detector. from hear "http://jmp.sh/4bIYiPU " place it place it same floder where alarm.wav contains 

- Note: without dlib‚Äôs pre-trained facial landmark detector file you can't run the code 

# step 3

```bash
python drowsiness detection.py

```
